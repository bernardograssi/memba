# Description
This project was the final project of Object Oriented Programming's class in the Fall of 2020. It consists of a program that allows the user to create, edit, store, delete, and 
export (as PDFs) snapshots of memory. These snapshots can consist of a description in the format of a text and/or audio, a single image, hashtags, location, date, and title.

# Motivation
I partned in this project with my classmate Allen Westgate, and our motivation to create this application was for people to keep track of their memories throughout their lifetimes,
but not necessarily sharing with the outer world, as it is done in social media. This application aims at enhancing the connection between a person and its own memories. Have you 
ever thought about getting old and forgetting about your own memories? With Memba, this will never happen.
